This directory contains an archive snapshot of the previous `deploy/` contents.

Files archived from original `deploy/` on 2025-11-07:
- backup-before-server-sync/ (moved out of deploy)
- home.html
- nginx_piazzati_parse_grafana_home.conf
- piazzati-backend.service
- README_DEPLOY.md
- restart_backend.sh
- systemd/

Reason: `deploy/` contained mixed legacy scripts, backups and conf copies. The
recommended production nginx config was moved to `frontend/nginx/nginx.prod.conf`.

If you need any of the archived files restored, retrieve them from the git history or
from the original `deploy/` folder before this cleanup commit.
